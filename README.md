I'm a Microsoft Azure MVP, a Cloud Solutions Architect and a coffee addict. I've been in love with computers since 1988.

I also had the great pleasure to contribute to the book "97 things every cloud engineer should know" by O'Reilly <https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/97-things-every/9781492076728/>

⚡ Fun fact:  
- I wrote my first line of code in 1988 in Basic on a Yamaha MSX.
