I'm a Microsoft Azure MVP, a Cloud Solutions Architect and a coffee addict. I've been in love with computers since 1988.

I am the proud author of the **first** book on building CLI applications with C# and .NET, published by Packt. Grab your copy from:
- The Packt website (https://lnkd.in/epf-di3s) 
- Amazon(https://packt.link/E7ySG).

I've also had the pleasure to contribute to the book "97 things every cloud engineer should know" by O'Reilly <https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/97-things-every/9781492076728/>
- https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/97-things-every/9781492076728/ch53.html
- https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/97-things-every/9781492076728/ch54.html

âš¡ Fun fact:  
- I wrote my first line of code in 1988 in Basic on a Yamaha MSX.
